Mother India
Makshipra and Maha Allya Bhai's
This holy city is known to the people here.
I arrived at the airport on time
But there was a delay in reaching here
And the delay happened because
That today Indore showed immense love
The blessings that were given from the airport to here were human on both sides
Chaid I would not bashan and would sleep so much road and go away
Even then the newspapers of the entire Maddha Present keep on increasing that Modhi's road was so forbidden
So much love has touched my heart today
If there is a city of the new attitude from the faith spirituality of ancient India to the new attitude of new India, then the name of the city is Indore
Indore as Ahalya Bhai Holkar gave inspirational leadership for the betterment of spirituality and humanity all over India
So in the last five years, India has led the campaign for Swachh Bharat Appian.
Today my Kashi residents are trying to fulfill the dream that Mahnalya Bhai had dreamt of building Baba Vishwanad temple in Kashi with Baba's blessings
Being a Member of Parliament from Banaras, I am particularly proud of this
Indore Te Mera Wishes has also been there because it is the city of Sumitra Tai
For the ninth time, this city elected him to serve the country, sent him to the parliament
And as a speaker, Sumitra Tay's work was done efficiently and patiently.
Not only that, whatever parlamen was going on at that time, if they were accustomed to watching TV, they all have left an amid arc on their minds.
And very few people will know that you will feel that Modhi ji is a minister but if anyone can dance to Modhi ji in my party, then he can dance
Sumitra Tay is contesting the elections of this entire Mantar state this time and is creating a new history
But friends, I have got a chance to work with Tai ji in Sangarthan
We have worked as a partner for his dedication to Kari
Their intention to do something for the life of the common man
Keeping all this in mind, I give Indore a viswa
That no one of Tay Ji will remain incomplete in the development of the city
I will never let you come short. I came to Indore Vajchi today to give a whistleblower.
I am heavy for one more thing from Indore and Mantya Pradesh.
You made one of my Agras a success very seriously
And that Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
If the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has reached the thinking of the common man of India,
So all my brothers from Indore deserve it
Friends, we have often seen the people standing up to remove the power route government in Besh
But this time the country has stood up to elect this government again from Kanya Kumari Kach from Kashmir
It is often said that the voter of the country is very silent
But this time the public is speaking loudly
And that is why so many leaders have been put to sleep
Now he has lost balance in speaking
They are standing
Friends, The 2014 election was about anti-incumbency.
The 2019 election is of pro incumbency
In 2014, the outrage against Brahmachar, Bonshawat and Policy Paralysis was at its peak
Junta's confidence is at its peak in 2019
In 2014, the country had only heard about Modhi and Modhi's work
In 2019, the country has started knowing Modhi's work
The Bharatiya Janata Party is not the only one contesting the 2019 elections
In fact, the Indian people are fighting the 2019 elections
130 crore countrymen are representing this election
Friends, My loyalty, my intentions and my policy can be under-assessed
But no one can find fault with my intentions, I can say this with confidence
It is because I live among the people, I constantly interact with the people
I've never had fun batting in air condition commands
On policy making, I have left the world of babughiri and tried to bring about a change in the country with public participation
Brothers and sisters, in the last five years, we have paid special attention to technology and transparency
Today, you see where India's global standing has reached in terms of technology
India has become the third largest start-up ecosystem in the world
Our young friends could get the third opportunity in the world
For this, in the coming five years, we will strengthen this ecosystem to further strengthen the startup financing.
