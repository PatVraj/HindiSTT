Bharat Mata Ki
Makshipra and Maha Alalya Bhai's
This holy city is known to the people of this place
I arrived at the airport on time
But there was a delay in arriving here
And the delay happened because
That the immense love that Indor has shown today
Those who gave blessings from the airport till here were human walls
Maybe I wouldn't bother and walk away after sleeping this road
Even so, the newspapers of Madha Prezesh keep increasing, so that Modhi's road was so strong
So much love Indore has touched my heart today
From the faith spirituality of ancient India to the new perspective of the new India, if any city is a symbol of the new attitude, then the name of the city is Indore.
In the form of Ahalya Bhai Holkar, Indore gave inspirational leadership for the good of spirituality and humanity across India
So in the last five years, Swachcha Bharat invited India for Apiyan
Today my Kashi residents are trying to fulfill the dream that Mahanalya Bhai had for the Baba Vishwanad temple in Kashi with the guidance of Baba
As a soulmate of Banaras, I am very proud of this
Indore and my wish is also because it is the city of Sumitra Tai
Nine times this city selected him and sent him to serve the country and sent him to Saundad
And as a speaker, Sumitra Tai told him who worked efficiently and systematically
Not only if any parlamen I was running at that time were addicted to watching TV, this has left an immense arc on the minds of all of them.
And very few people will know that you will feel that Modhi ji has a mantri, but if anyone can dissuade Modhi ji in the Mari party, then he can disappoint him.
This time Sumitra Tay is fighting the elections of this entire Mantar Pradesh and creating a new history
But at the same time, I have got the opportunity to work with Tay ji in Sangarthan
We have worked as a partner to dedicate his dedication to Kari
His intentions of doing something for the common man's life
Keeping all this in mind, I give Indore a free hand
That no one of Tay ji will be incomplete in the development of the city
I will never let Kami come. I came to Indore Vajachis today to give me a trust
Satyaon Indore and Mantya Pradesh I am too heavy for one more thing
You have made one of my Agra successful with great grace
And that Swachcha Bharat Abhiyan
If Swachcha Bharat Abhiyan has reached the thinking of the common man of India
So all my brothers of Indore deserve this, Vehan
Friends, we have often seen people standing up to remove the power root government in Besh
But this time from Kashmir to Kanya Kumari Kach to Kamrob, this time the country has stood up to elect this government again.
It is often said that the voters of the country are very silent
But this time the public is speaking louder
And this is the reason why there are many leaders whose blasphemy has been harmed
Now he has lost his balance in speaking
They are standing
Friends, the election of 2014 was of anti-incumbency
The election of 2019 is that of Pro Incumbency
In 2014, outrage against Brosthachar, Bonshwat and Policy Parolysis was extreme
Janta's faith is at its peak in 2019
In 2014, the country had only heard about the work of Modhi and Modhi
In 2019, the country is beginning to know about Modhi's work
Only Bharatiya Janata Party is not contesting the 2019 elections
But the Indian people are contesting the elections of 2019
130 crore countrymen are deciding this election
Colleagues, my loyalty, my destiny and my policy may be under-assessed
But no one can fault my intentions, I can confidently say that
This is because I live amongst the people, I interact with the people continuously
I have never had fun by batting on my conditioned commons
On policy formulation, I have left the world of Babughiri and tried to bring change in the country with public participation
Brother Behno. In the last five years, we have paid special attention to technology and transparency.
Today you see where India's global staining has reached in terms of technology
On seeing this, India has become the third largest start-up eco-system in the world
Third in the world our youth friends could get a great opportunity
For this purpose, in the next five years, we will strengthen the start-up fundraising of this eco-system
