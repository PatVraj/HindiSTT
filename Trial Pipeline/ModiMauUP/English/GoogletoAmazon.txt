[00:00 - 00:12] Today I have a limit of time for Bharat Mata ki Bharat Mata (Confidence: 0.96)
[00:12 - 00:52] Bharat Mata's Bharat Mata ki Rava everyone bowed to her with folded hands (Confidence: 0.76)
[00:52 - 01:40] You see this number of Logons (Confidence: 0.75)
[01:40 - 02:42] Yes, I believe it. Bani's great adulterated Logan's boreya bed was tied (Confidence: 0.81)
[02:42 - 04:04] Friends, there are two days left for the seventh phase of voting, whereas there are only 7 days left for the Lok Sabha election results (Confidence: 0.86)
[04:04 - 05:35] The announcement will be made on 23rd May and once again (Confidence: 0.90)
[05:35 - 07:17] Brothers and sisters take the great adulteration that a month ago (Confidence: 0.81)
[07:17 - 09:17] Till a month ago, he was enjoying the benefits of removing Modi and removing Modi. Today he is shocked (Confidence: 0.88)
[09:17 - 11:31] The whole country has sealed his defeat and moved forward in Uttar Pradesh (Confidence: 0.89)
[11:31 - 13:59] All their multiplication has spoiled their math, so every day their abuses are increasing. Brothers and sisters (Confidence: 0.94)
[13:59 - 16:58] Actually the country knows the truth about these great adulterated parties from the first day. The country knows that the slogan of removing Modi was an excuse. Actually they had to hide their sin of corruption (Confidence: 0.92)
[16:58 - 20:29] Therefore, they are trying to form a khichdi government in the country. They wanted a forced government in the country so that they could blackmail them according to their needs, but this is New India that kills terrorists by entering their homes (Confidence: 0.90)
[20:29 - 24:45] And those who want to weaken their homes, their society, their country, they know it very well. Brothers and sisters. Here in Uttar Pradesh, SP BSP tried to form an opportunistic alliance on the basis of caste. Sitting in the AC room in Lucknow, the deal was made from the top (Confidence: 0.93)
[24:45 - 29:23] But these leaders who were cut off from the ground have forgotten their workers. The result is that the workers of SP and BSP are attacking each other even today (Confidence: 0.93)
[29:23 - 34:03] Companions (Confidence: 0.95)
[34:03 - 39:07] Second mistake SP made by thinking that both parties would transfer their votes to each other. Brothers and sisters, these people considered some castes as their slaves (Confidence: 0.90)
[39:07 - 44:13] in 2014 (Confidence: 0.92)
[44:13 - 49:42] After explaining for the first time in 2017, after explaining it for the second time in 2017, Uttar Pradesh is going to explain to these two properly in 2019 that castes are not your slaves (Confidence: 0.90)
[49:42 - 55:49] People understand very well that votes are given, votes are given for development. Brothers and sisters. Brothers and sisters have only secured power in the name of caste to advance the country and then used the power to build bungalows for themselves to make their relatives millionaires (Confidence: 0.93)
[55:49 - 62:32] Whether it is aunt or babua, these people have distanced themselves so much from the poor. They have distanced themselves so much. These people have built such a high wall of their courtiers with the power of splendor of money that they do not see the happiness and sorrow of the poor (Confidence: 0.91)
[62:32 - 69:19] Brothers and Sisters (Confidence: 0.72)
[69:19 - 76:10] Separate from these adulterated people (Confidence: 0.78)
[76:10 - 83:34] I am trying to make life easier for the poor to make their lives easier. I am trying to provide the facilities they had been waiting for decades. I am trying to provide the poor with a firm house, an electricity connection to the house, a gas connection, a toilet and a bank account (Confidence: 0.91)
[83:34 - 91:44] When her child gets vaccinated on time, she gets cheap treatment, she gets cheap rations to reach her home. We are working on these goals. Friends, I am false in providing direct assistance to the bank accounts of families who had to borrow loans for small agricultural expenses. Friends, on the one hand, this servant of yours is engaged in empowering the daughters of the country (Confidence: 0.:0. 93)
[91:44 - 99:57] The same great adulterant (Confidence: 0.65)
[99:57 - 108:27] Insults daughters for their votes. Our government has taken the initiative to free Muslim sisters the triple talaq map (Confidence: 0.94)
[108:27 - 117:19] But together these great adulterants have hampered Muslim sisters and daughters in getting justice. The government wants Muslim women according to their sentiments (Confidence: 0.94)
[117:19 - 126:17] Against Triple Talaq within the framework of their faith (Confidence: 0.92)
[126:17 - 135:42] Get the right to raise voice, but this great adulterated pulse is not allowing this to happen. Is the attitude of these people visible even in the candidates of major adulteration? SP BSP has given a ticket to such candidates from here (Confidence: 0.92)
[135:42 - 145:12] Who was accused of rape (Confidence: 0.93)
[145:12 - 154:47] is a fugitive (Confidence: 0.88)
[154:47 - 164:41] People of Uttar Pradesh know the history of the Samajwadi Party, but sister, will you ask for votes for such candidates (Confidence: 0.92)
[164:41 - 174:49] Brothers and sisters all know what was the situation of daughters in UP at the time (Confidence: 0.88)
[174:49 - 185:15] But sister, your behavior regarding women's safety is now under question. A few days ago in Alwar, Rajasthan (Confidence: 0.90)
[185:15 - 195:44] With a Dalit Daughter (Confidence: 0.95)
[195:44 - 206:40] The gang was raped there with the support of the sister. The Congress government is running there with the support of the sister. Considering the election, the Congress government tried to hide this monstrous crime committed to that Dalit daughter (Confidence: 0.91)
[206:40 - 217:51] Sister knows everything, but instead of withdrawing support from the Congress government, she is trying to abuse Modi (Confidence: 0.91)
[217:51 - 229:40] This attitude of sister with Dalit daughter indicates that we great adulterants can deceive anyone for their own interests. Brothers and sisters. Our government is committed to the safety of women's interests. For the first time in the history of independence, this watchman has made provision for the execution of death penalty in the rape case (Confidence: 0.93)
[229:40 - 241:42] I meet the women here (Confidence: 0.94)
[241:42 - 254:08] I would make special requests to the women of Purvanchal OK to vote with full force against such anti-women parties. Women's dignity and vote for their interests (Confidence: 0.93)
[254:08 - 266:45] Pressing the button on the lotus mark means the execution of rapists (Confidence: 0.96)
[266:45 - 280:04] Pressing the button on the lotus mark means having water facilities from house to house toilet friends. I found out that sister has targeted me regarding West Bengal. I took a dig at the Election Commission as well. I was thinking that the way Mamta didi was there (Confidence: 0.95)
[280:04 - 293:49] UP-Bihar is targeting the people of Purvanchal. Sister Mayawali is doing her politics by calling them outsiders. (Confidence: 0.91)
[293:49 - 307:47] But this did not happen because they are not worried about you. They played the chair game (Confidence: 0.88)
[307:47 - 321:54] Friends, after meeting here in UP (Confidence: 0.91)
[321:54 - 336:06] I am going to Bengal once again today (Confidence: 0.93)
[336:06 - 350:24] Chief Minister of Bengal (Confidence: 0.82)
[350:24 - 364:49] Chief Minister elected by democracy (Confidence: 0.95)
[364:49 - 379:17] Bandharan of India (Confidence: 0.94)
[379:17 - 394:03] India's democracy. Modi, who was elected prime minister with the blessings of 130 crore countrymen, is not considered by the Chief Minister of Bengal as his prime minister (Confidence: 0.92)
[394:03 - 409:44] She considers the Prime Minister of Pakistan as Prime Minister but she does not consider the Prime Minister of India as Prime Minister and brothers and sisters, when I am going to Bengal, I remind my countrymen today. A few months ago, when I had a rally in West Midnapore, what kind of chaos was spread by the TMC. After that, my meeting in Thakurnagar in Bengal, this situation was created by my meeting in Thakurnagar in Bengal. It was made that I had to leave my address midway and withdraw from the stage (Confidence: 0.93)
[409:44 - 425:42] A few days ago, Kunj came to Bihar for my rally, where the stage was being built, Didi had built a big platform for her party (Confidence: 0.90)
[425:42 - 442:06] Didi has been doing all this in an anti-democracy mindset under the influence of power, I have been watching Didi's attitude for a long time. Now the whole country is also watching. This evening I will have a rally in Dumdum in Kolkata (Confidence: 0.93)
[442:06 - 458:39] Let's see if Didi allows this rally to happen or not (Confidence: 0.95)
[458:39 - 475:20] If it works, it will not allow our helicopter to land there (Confidence: 0.92)
[475:20 - 492:10] Friends, the bullying of TMC hooligans was witnessed last night as well (Confidence: 0.83)
[492:10 - 509:18] During the road show of Bhai Amit Shah in Kolkata yesterday, PMC goons broke the statue of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar. To those who did so (Confidence: 0.93)
[509:18 - 526:31] Harsher punishment should be given (Confidence: 0.96)
[526:31 - 544:11] I would like to say that our government dedicated to the season of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar will install a grand statue of Panch Metal in the same place and reply to the hooligans of TMC (Confidence: 0.90)
[544:11 - 562:30] Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar is a great personality not only of Bengal but of India. He is not a great social reformer educationist but a guardian of the poor and the Dalits and Dalits. He raised his voice for the rights of women during that time. We are all indebted to what he has done for the service of humanity (Confidence: 0.91)
[562:30 - 581:18] Our government is working to take the country to new heights with the inspiration of such personalities. The BJP government's core is devotion to the culture of Bengal. Similarly, Vivekananda Park and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Government Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee (Confidence: 0.91)
[581:18 - 601:06] Bengal's energy has influenced our thoughts. Brothers and sisters. In the 21st century, the country needs a government with a huge majority. Only a strong government can realize the slogan of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan. With a strong government, the dream of a developed India can come true. Only a strong government can develop Purvanchal and Eastern India. This is the reason why this entire region can develop this entire region. We have given special priority to rail, road or waterway built on the Ganges, this entire area is being transformed (Confidence: 0.92)
[601:06 - 621:13] This is going to create new employment opportunities for industries and enterprises. Friends, this time Ghosi has to break last time's record (Confidence: 0.94)
[621:13 - 641:47] You have to play a lotus at 11 booths. Every vote will go directly to Modi's account. I am very grateful to you for giving such huge blessings to Mother India (Confidence: 0.92)
[641:47 - 662:56] Your assembly results to your workers (Confidence: 0.81)
