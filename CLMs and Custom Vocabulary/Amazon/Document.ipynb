    "# Hindi Audio to English Text Conversion using AWS Services\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This document provides a comprehensive guide for setting up a process to convert Hindi audio to English text using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Python. The process involves using AWS Transcribe for speech-to-text conversion and AWS Translate for translating the text from Hindi to English.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "Before starting, ensure the following prerequisites are met:\n",
    "1. **AWS Account**: You must have an active AWS account.\n",
    "2. **AWS CLI**: The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) should be installed and configured with your AWS credentials.\n",
    "3. **Python Environment**: Ensure Python is installed on your system along with necessary libraries such as `boto3` and `requests`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up AWS CLI\n",
    "To set up the AWS CLI, run the following command in your terminal and provide your AWS credentials when prompted:\n",
    "\n",
    "``aws configure``\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "You will need to enter your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, default region, and output format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Required Python Libraries\n",
    "Ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed. Use the following command to install them:\n"

    "## Uploading Audio File to S3\n",
    "AWS Transcribe requires the audio file to be stored in an S3 bucket. You need to upload your audio file to an S3 bucket. This involves creating an S3 client, specifying your bucket name, and the path to your audio file. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Using AWS Transcribe\n",
    "AWS Transcribe converts audio to text. You will start a transcription job by specifying the S3 URI of the audio file, the media format, and the language code for Hindi (`hi-IN`). The transcription job will process the audio file and generate a transcript.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Retrieving the Transcription\n",
    "Once the transcription job is complete, the transcription output can be retrieved from the specified S3 location. The transcription is provided in JSON format, which includes the transcribed text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Translating Hindi Text to English using AWS Translate\n",
    "AWS Translate can be used to convert the transcribed Hindi text to English. This involves calling the translate service with the source language code (`hi`) and the target language code (`en`). The service will return the translated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Considerations\n",
    "1. **Custom Vocabulary**: To improve transcription accuracy for domain-specific terminology or proper nouns, you can create and use a custom vocabulary in AWS Transcribe. This involves uploading a vocabulary file to S3 and specifying the custom vocabulary name when starting the transcription job.\n",
    "2. **Audio Format**: Ensure your audio file is in a format supported by AWS Transcribe. Supported formats include MP3, MP4, WAV, and FLAC.\n",
    "3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage potential issues such as network errors, API rate limits, and invalid input formats.\n",
    "4. **File Size and Duration Limits**: AWS Transcribe supports audio files up to 4 hours in length or 2 GB in size. For longer recordings, consider splitting the audio file.\n",
    "5. **AWS Costs**: Be aware of the costs associated with using AWS Transcribe and Translate. Refer to the AWS pricing page for details.\n",
    "6. **Language and Region Support**: Ensure the language code (`hi-IN` for Hindi) and the region support for both AWS Transcribe and Translate are correctly configured in your AWS account.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This document outlines the process of converting Hindi audio to English text using AWS services. By following these steps, you can set up a robust pipeline for audio transcription and translation, ensuring accurate and efficient conversion of Hindi speech to English text.\n"
