The country knows that the slogan of remove Modi was just an excuse, in fact they had to hide their sin of corruption (Confidence: 0.92) [16:58 - 20 :29] That&#39;s why they are trying somehow to form a government in the country. They wanted a forced government in the country so that they can blackmail as per their need, but this is the new India that kills the terrorists by entering their homes. (Confidence: 0.90) [20:29 - 24:45] And he knows very well those who want to weaken their home, their society, their country. Brothers and sisters, here in Uttar Pradesh, SP and BSP have attacked on the basis of caste. Tried to form an opportunistic alliance on the basis of sitting in an AC room in Lucknow; superficially the deal was done (Confidence: 0.93) [24:45 - 29:23] But this leader, cut off from the ground, forgot his workers, the result That SP and BSP workers are still attacking each other (Confidence: 0.93) [29:23 - 34:03] Friends (Confidence: 0.95) [34:03 - 39:07] Second mistake made by SP and BSP Brothers and sisters, these people had considered some castes as their slaves, thinking that their votes would be transferred to both the parties (Confidence: 0.90) [39:07 - 44:13] in 2014 (Confidence: 0.92 ) [44:13 - 49:42] After explaining for the first time and after explaining for the second time in 2017, now in 2019, Uttar Pradesh is going to explain to both of them a little better that castes are not your slaves (Confidence: 0.90) [49 :42 - 55:49] People understand very well that votes are given for development, votes are given to take the country forward, brothers and sisters, these people only gained power in the name of caste and then lost power. They have used it to build bungalows for themselves and make even their relatives millionaires and billionaires (Confidence: 0.93) [55:49 - 62:32] Now whether it is aunt or uncle, these people have distanced themselves so much from the poor. These people have built around themselves such a high wall of money, glory and muscle power of their courtiers that they cannot see the happiness and sorrow of the poor (Confidence: 0.91) [62:32 - 69:19] Brothers and sisters. (Confidence: 0.72) [69:19 - 76:10] Unlike these big adulterated people (Confidence: 0.78) [76:10 - 83:34] I have been trying very sincerely to make the life of the poor easier for decades. I am busy in providing him the facilities he was waiting for. The poor should get a permanent house, there should be electricity connection in the house, there should be gas connection, there should be toilet, I eat in the bank (Confidence: 0.91) [83:34 - 91:44] His Children should be vaccinated on time, they should get cheap treatment, they should get cheap ration, roads should reach their homes, we are working on these goals. Friends, I am also a liar in giving direct help to the bank accounts of those families who need small-scale farming related services. Had to take loan for expenses Friends, on one hand this servant of yours is busy in empowering the daughters of the country (Confidence: 0.93) [91:44 - 99:57] On the other hand, this great adulterer (Confidence: 0.65) [99:57 - 108:27] Our government also took the initiative to liberate Muslim sisters from the triple talaq map. [108:27 - 117:19] But these great adulterated people together There are obstacles in providing justice to sisters and daughters. The government wants Muslim women to be free from triple talaq as per their feelings (Confidence: 0.94) [117:19 - 126:17] Within the scope of their faith (Confidence: 0.92) [126 :17 - 135:42] Get the right to raise your voice but this great adulterated person is not allowing this to happen.

All this. We know (Confidence: 0.88) [174:49 - 185:15] But sister, your behavior regarding women&#39;s safety is also under question. A few days ago in Alwar, Rajasthan (Confidence: 0.90) [185:15 - 195: 44] A Dalit daughter was gang raped (Confidence: 0.95) [195:44 - 206:40] The Congress government is running there with the support of her sister. Keeping in view the elections, the Dalit daughter was gang raped. Tried to hide this monstrous crime (Confidence: 0.91) [206:40 - 217:51] Sister knows everything but instead of withdrawing support from the Congress government, she is busy abusing Modi (Confidence: 0.91) ) [217:51 - 229:40] This attitude of sister ji with the Dalit daughter shows that we great adulterers can deceive anyone for our selfishness. Brothers and sisters, our government is committed to women&#39;s interests, women&#39;s safety, freedom. For the first time in the history of rape, this watchman has made the provision of death sentence in a rape case. (Confidence: 0.93) [229:40 - 241:42] I tell the women here (Confidence: 0.94) [241:42 - 254: 08] I will make a special request to the women of entire Purvanchal OK to vote with full force against such anti-women parties.

Friends, to come. When I was on the way, I came to know that sister has targeted me regarding West Bengal and has also taken the Election Commission to task. I was thinking that the way Mamata didi was there (Confidence: 0.95) [280:04 - 293 :49] UP-Bihar is targeting the people of Purvanchal and is doing her politics by calling them outsiders. Sister Mayawati must have scolded Mamata Didi on this (Confidence: 0.91) [293:49 - 307:47 ] But this did not happen because they are not worried about you, they just play the chair game (Confidence: 0.88) [307:47 - 321:54] Friends, after the meeting here in UP (Confidence: 0.91) [321:54 - 336: 06] I am going to Bengal once again today (Confidence: 0.93) [336:06 - 350:24] Chief Minister of Bengal (Confidence: 0.82) [350:24 - 364:49] Chief Minister elected by democracy (Confidence : 0.95) [364:49 - 379:17] Confidence of India (Confidence: 0.94) [379:17 - 394:03] Democracy of India Modi, who has been elected as Prime Minister with the blessings of 130 crore countrymen, is considered the Chief Minister of Bengal as his Prime Minister. She does not believe (Confidence: 0.92) [394:03 - 409:44] She considers the Prime Minister of Pakistan as the Prime Minister but does not consider the Prime Minister of India as the Prime Minister. And brothers and sisters, today when I am going to Bengal, I remind the countrymen. Today, a few months ago, when I had a rally in West Midnapore, what kind of anarchy was spread by the TMC there. After this, my Sabhaji in Thakurnagar in Bengal was given such a condition that I had to leave my address and leave the stage. Had to move away (Confidence: 0.93) [409:44 - 425:42] A few days ago, Kunj came to Bihar for my rally where Didi had built a big stage for her party where the stage was being built (Confidence: 0.90) [425:42 - 442:06] Didi, you have been doing all this in the intoxication of power with an anti-democratic mentality. I have been watching Didi&#39;s attitude for a long time, now the whole country is also watching, this evening in Kolkata, Dum Dum. I also have a rally (Confidence: 0.93) [442:06 - 458:39] Let&#39;s see whether Didi allows this rally to happen or not (Confidence: 0.95) [458:39 - 475:20] If she wants, we can send our helicopter there. Will not even let you get down (Confidence: 0.92) [475:20 - 492:10] Friends, bullying by TMC goons was seen the night before yesterday also (Confidence: 0.83) [492:10 - 509:18] Brother Amit in Kolkata the day before yesterday. PMC goons vandalized the statue of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar during Shah&#39;s road show. Those who did so should be given the harshest punishment (Confidence: 0.93) [509:18 - 526:31] (Confidence: 0.96) [526 :31 - 544:11] At the same time, I would also like to say that our government, dedicated to the season of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar ji, will establish a grand statue of Panch Dhatu at the same place and give answer to the goons of TMC (Confidence: 0.90) [ 544:11 - 562:30] Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar is a great personality not only of Bengal but of India. He was not only a great social reformer and educationist but also a protector of the poor and Dalits. He raised his voice for the rights of women in that era. We are all indebted to him for what he has done to serve humanity (Confidence: 0.91) [562:30 - 581:18] Our government is working to take the country to new heights with the inspiration of such great personalities. The BJP government has devotion to the culture of Bengal at its core. However, Vivekananda Park and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose government Dr. Syama Prasad Mukherjee (Confidence: 0.91) [581:18 - 601:06] Our thinking has been influenced by the energy of Bengal. Brothers and sisters, in the 21st century, the country needs a strong and full majority government. Only a strong government can make the slogan of Jai Jawan Jai Kisan come true. Only a strong government can make the dream of a developed India come true. Only a strong government can achieve Purvanchal and Eastern India. This is the reason why we have given special priority to this entire region, whether it is rail, road or waterway built on Ganga. This entire region is being rejuvenated (Confidence: 0.92) [601:06 - 621:13] Due to this New employment opportunities are going to be created here for the industries. Friends, this time Ghosi has to break the record of the last time. (Confidence: 0.94) [621:13 - 641:47] You have to feed lotus at 11 booths. The vote will go directly to Modi&#39;s account.
